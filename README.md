# Sheriff's Office Information Hub (patrol)
> Information management tool to allow for better data tracking of specific tasks within the organization

Tracks the occurances of certain tasks that need approval from a supervisor. In simplest terms this tool presents the user with a form to complete and submit. The form is placed into a user queue to be approved or denied by the next level supervisor. If approved the form moves up the chain of command; if denied, back to the user. 

_The primary communication channel is email._
